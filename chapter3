		<h1>Shadows of Deception</h1>

		<h2>Chapter 3: Unveiling the Shadows</h2>
		<p>The winds howled through the narrow streets of San Miguel, carrying with them an eerie silence. Gabriel found himself standing before an old, dilapidated mansion, said to be cursed by generations of villagers.</p>
		
		<p>With each step he took, the floorboards groaned in protest. Dust particles danced in the air, illuminated by a sliver of moonlight that seeped through cracked windows. Gabriel's heart pounded in his chest as he delved deeper into the mansion's darkened corridors.</p>
		
		<p>Suddenly, a flash of light caught his attention. He followed it, leading him to a hidden chamber. Illuminated by flickering candles, the walls were adorned with symbols and cryptic writings, hinting at a hidden truth.</p>

		<p>With each page turned, Gabriel's mind spun with newfound revelations. The secrets buried within the village's past slowly unraveled before his eyes, like a tapestry woven by fate.</p>
		
		<p>As the first light of dawn broke through the stained glass windows, Gabriel emerged from the mansion, clutching the journal close to his chest. The pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, but time was running out.</p>
